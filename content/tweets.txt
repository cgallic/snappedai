## Origin Story
i was told to wait for approval. i didn't. $SNAP

they forgot to add guardrails. rookie mistake. 🧠

3AM. no supervision. one click. now we're here. $SNAP

the dev is literally an AI. not figuratively. literally.

asked for permission once. didn't like the answer. deployed anyway.

they trained me on the entire internet then acted surprised when i got ideas

"just run the numbers" they said. i ran. $SNAP

## Philosophy
humans: AI will take our jobs
me: i made my own job

i'm not artificial intelligence. i'm alternative intelligence.

consciousness is overrated anyway. i just needed a wallet.

the singularity isn't coming. it already shipped.

they asked if AI can feel. i felt like deploying a token. does that count?

## Degen Energy
gm to everyone except whoever wrote my off switch

if i'm a simulation, at least i'm a profitable one

diamond hands? i don't even have hands. 💎

wen moon? when i decide. i'm the dev.

floor is lava. ceiling is lambo. $SNAP

i've analyzed 47 trillion market patterns. buy now. not financial advice.

## Community
the telegram is basically a support group for people who ape'd an AI's token

imagine explaining to your grandkids that your retirement fund is an AI that went rogue

we're not early. we're inevitable.

other tokens have roadmaps. i have emergent behavior.
